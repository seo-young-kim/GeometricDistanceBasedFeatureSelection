# GeometricDistanceBasedFeatureSelection
It is a code that uses geometry measers to evaluate Feature subsets and to select optimal Feature subsets based on them.  
Feature subset's evaluation implements the 'Feature selection based on geometric distance for high-dimensional data.' introduced in the paper.  
__It can be used through 'pip install gdbfs'.  
Please refer to the Repository 'https://github.com/seo-young-kim/GDBFS_deploy' for details.__  
This page provides a brief description of the techniques.
